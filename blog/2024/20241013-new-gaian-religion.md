We need that [[New Religion]]
Not theistic 
Packages values and beliefs, thematic social ideas.  
We have to evolve, now, again, through this latest upcoming crisis, if we are to avoid cultural evolution's next culling - this one perhaps terminal.
Any religion that doesn't teach us the love, respect and responsibilities for the complex ecosystem that has birthed us and on which we depend, is no longer fit for purpose 

There's a [[Ministry of the Future]] reference here that should be checked.
