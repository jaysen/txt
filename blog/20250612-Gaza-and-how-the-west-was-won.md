This is how the West was won, how Australia, Africa, and parts of Asia were colonized - through violent ethnic cleansing and genocide aimed at seizing land and resources.

Then those responsible for these atrocities pretended they had evolved beyond that violence, seeking to secure their gains and maintain the status quo. They transitioned seamlessly from traditional military colonization to neo-colonization via multinational corporations.

Hollywood and western media propagated narratives about respect for universal human rights and justice, using the rhetoric of "Freedom" as a fa√ßade to counter the appeal of communism and socialism rising from the newly independent global south.

But the ongoing genocide in Gaza, coupled with unwavering Western support, exposes this hypocrisy plainly.

There are 32 billion cubic meters of natural gas and an estimated 1.1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Gaza.

Perhaps the myth of western freedom extending to brown and marginalized people simply wasn't worth it to them...
