This is how the west was won, how australia and africa and parts of asia were colonised -using violent ethnic cleansing and genocide to steal land and resources.

Then those that stole pretended that they had progressed beyond violence to secure their spoils and preserve the status quo, and to slip deftly from traditional military colonisation to the neo-colonisation of multinational corporations. 

Hollywood and their news told of their respect for universal human rights and justice and used this pretense of 'Freedom' to compete with the promise of communism and socialism rising in a newly freed south. 

But the genocide in Gaza, and the west's unwavering support  shows that all up.

There are 32 billion cubic metres of natural gas and an estimated 1.1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Gaza and in a new calculus of risk and reward, it just wasn't worth maintaining the farce of western freedom.
